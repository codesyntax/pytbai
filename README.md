# pytbai

pytbai allows to create, manage and send TicketBai invoices to the Basque tax authorities.

## Usage

You need to configure your bussiness and software info in a JSON file:

```json
{
  "subject": {
    "entity_id": "99999974E",
    "name": "BUSSINESS NAME"
  },
  "software": {
    "license": "TBAIGIPRE00000000501",
    "dev_entity": "P2000000F",
    "soft_name": "TBAI",
    "soft_version": "1.0"
  }
}
```

Then create a invoice:

```python
from pytbai import TBai
from decimal import Decimal

tbai = TBai(json)
invoice = tbai.create_invoice("TB-2021-S", 1, "First invoice", "S")

invoice.create_line("First product", Decimal("1"), Decimal("200"), Decimal("20"))
invoice.create_line("Second product", Decimal("2"), Decimal("350"))
```

The `json` parameter is a previous JSON file you've created.

Finally sign and send the invoice:

```python
result = tbai.sign_and_send("/path_to_p12_certificate", "password")
```

You can also get the full structure of TBai invoice:

```python
json_structure = tbai.get_json(invoice)
```
